## Learning Scala:
If you are already experienced in Java, then Scala should be quite simple for you to get hands on, if you are feeling lucky, you can directly start with code as well 

Main Docs:
https://docs.scala-lang.org/

Good Links to get started:
- Tour of Scala: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html
- A nice learning guide (easy to follow): https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/
(You only need to follow one of the above links)

- A course by the professor who created the language (Martin Odersky): https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-functional-programming

Good Books (if you want to go deep):
https://docs.scala-lang.org/books.html

## Learning Akka:
Akka is a framework for the Actor Model written in Java/Scala.

If you want to go hands on, read, learn and execute at the same time, then Akka getting started guide is great!
This will also give you insight into what is actor model and how it works.

If you learn better via video lectures / courses (following along):

## Learning about Kafka:
- Kafka overview : https://kafka.apache.org/intro
- Kafka producer : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#theproducer
- Kafka Consumer : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#theconsumer
- kafka Topic : https://dattell.com/data-architecture-blog/what-is-a-kafka-topic/
